# AI Canva

> Build AI pipelines visually. Place boxes on a canvas, connect them, and run AI prompts that flow content from box to box.

A collaborative, AI-powered whiteboard where you compose visual pipelines of AI "boxes". Drop an **Idea** box, connect it to a **Research** box, run an AI model, then chain the output into a **PRD**, **Slides**, **Code**, **UI Design**, or **Stitch UI** box. Watch your ideas flow from research to a working prototype — without leaving the canvas.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual pipelines** — drag boxes onto a canvas and connect them; content flows box to box.
- **11 box types** — Idea, Image, Research, Summarize, PRD, Dev Plan, Cartoon Profile, Slides, Code, UI Design, and Stitch UI.
- **AI-powered** — Ollama (LLM) for text, fal.ai for image generation, Google Stitch for production-quality UI screens.
- **Real-time collaboration** — share boards by email, live cursors with names/colors, and live multi-user editing via Firestore.
- **Cloud persistence** — boards auto-save to Firestore (with localStorage as an offline cache). Sign in with Google to use the app; your boards are stored per user.
- **Editable prompt templates** — reference connected inputs by name (`{{Box Name}}`, `{{input_1}}`, `{{inputs}}`) right in the settings panel.
- **Live code previews** — Code and UI boxes render generated React components in an iframe with copy/save.

## 📦 Box Types

| Box | Icon | Type | Description |
|-----|------|------|-------------|
| **Idea** | 💡 | Input | Free-text input. No AI — just write your idea. The seed of most pipelines. |
| **Image** | 🖼️ | Input | Upload an image (auto-resized to ≤1024px). Becomes input for downstream boxes. |
| **Research** | 🔍 | Worker | Runs an AI prompt over connected inputs and returns research findings. |
| **Summarize** | 📋 | Worker | Combines multiple upstream inputs into a concise AI summary. |
| **PRD** | 📄 | Worker | Generates a Product Requirements Document (features, user stories, specs) — ideal input for the Code box. |
| **Dev Plan** | 🗺️ | Worker | Transforms a PRD into a short, practical development plan (components, state, functions, build order). |
| **Cartoon Profile** | 🎨 | Worker | Generates a cartoon avatar via fal.ai — image-to-image from an Image box, or text-to-image from an Idea box. |
| **Slides** | 📊 | Worker | Generates a visual pitch deck with prev/next navigation. |
| **Code** | 💻 | Worker | Generates a React prototype with a live preview, copy, and download. |
| **UI Design** | ✨ | Worker | Generates production-quality React UIs with Tailwind CSS + Google Fonts. |
| **Stitch UI** | 🧵 | Worker | Generates UI screens using Google Stitch; returns polished HTML directly. |

> A "custom" box category is reserved on the sidebar for future box types.

## 🚀 Quick Start (local development)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ai-canva
cd ai-canva
npm install                 # root tooling (concurrently)
npm run install:all         # installs server/ + client/ deps
```

### 2. Configure API keys

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env and fill in real keys:
#   OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-ollama-api-key              # https://ollama.com/settings/keys
#   FAL_KEY=your-fal-key-here                      # https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys
#   STITCH_API_KEY=your-stitch-key-here            # https://stitch.withgoogle.com
```

The server works without Firebase for local experimentation. It only needs the AI keys above
(`OLLAMA_API_KEY` is required for text boxes; `FAL_KEY` for Cartoon boxes; `STITCH_API_KEY` for
Stitch UI boxes). By default it calls **Ollama Cloud** at `https://ollama.com` — set `OLLAMA_MODEL`
in `server/.env` to choose a model (see `server/.env.example`).

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Client (Vite):** http://localhost:5173
- **Server (Express):** http://localhost:3001 (or the next available port)

Both processes detect if their default port is in use and switch to the next free one. The client reads the server's actual port from `.server-port` so its `/api` proxy always works.

> **Optional:** To use accounts, cloud save, real-time collaboration, and image uploads, set up Firebase (see [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)) and put your project's config into `client/src/lib/firebase.ts`.

---

## 🎨 Using the app

1. Click **+ Add** in the top bar to open the box panel (or use the collapsed tab on the right).
2. Click a box type to add it. Type your idea in an **Idea** box, or upload an image in an **Image** box.
3. **Connect** boxes: drag from a box's right edge (`●`) to another box's left edge (`●`).
4. Click **▶ Run** on any AI box to generate its output.
5. Click **⚙** to edit a box's prompt template, system prompt, and inputs.
6. **Resize** any box: click it, then drag the corner/edge handles.
7. Click a box's title to **rename** it.

### Prompt template variables

AI boxes use prompt templates that fill in values from connected upstream boxes:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `{{Box Name}}` | The output of a connected box, matched by that box's **name** (case-insensitive). |
| `{{input_1}}`, `{{input_2}}` | Positional references to the Nth connected input. |
| `{{input}}` | Alias for the first input. |
| `{{inputs}}` | All connected inputs, concatenated and labeled by box name. |

In the settings panel you can click a connected box's name (or `{{inputs}}`) to insert the variable at the cursor.

### Example pipelines

**Research → summary**

```
Idea Box ──▶ Research Box ──▶ Summarize Box
             Research Box 2 ──┘
```

**Full product flow (recommended for code generation)**

```
Idea Box ──▶ Research Box ──▶ PRD Box ──▶ Dev Plan ──▶ Code Box
```

**Pitch deck**

```
Idea Box ──▶ Research Box ──▶ Slides Box
```

**Cartoon avatar** — connect an **Image** box for image-to-image, or an **Idea** box for text-to-image.

## 👥 Collaboration

When signed in with Google, your boards live in Firestore.

- **Boards** — open **📋 Boards** in the header to list, switch, create, or delete boards.
- **Share** — click **👥 Share** to get a share link, or add collaborators by email.
- **Live cursors** — active collaborators appear as colored avatars in the header; their cursors show on the canvas in real time.
- **Open a shared board** — visit `your-app/?board=<boardId>`.
- **Persistence** — boards auto-save to Firestore (debounced ~1s after changes). When not signed in, boards save only to localStorage.

## 🔐 Security rules

The repo ships a `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` intended to keep each user's boards private. **Note:** the current `firestore.rules` contain a permissive placeholder (any signed-in user can read/update any board) — see [docs/OSS_READINESS.md](docs/OSS_READINESS.md) for the recommended fix before deploying publicly.
